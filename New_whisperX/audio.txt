The framework that we work with is that if there is a government land, then it is put to the market for disposal.
So I suppose there is that little bit of conflict, perceived conflict with what we do and the policy that exists.
So it's probably quite variable, I guess, depending on the politics of the day.
Have you mentioned that there's a framework you're working with in there?
Would you say you're more guided by that framework or the politics of the day when you're making those decisions?
It is the framework.
So the government land transaction guidelines dictate that we are selling government land, more surplus government landage.
So that's what we work within.

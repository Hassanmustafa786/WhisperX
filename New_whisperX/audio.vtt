The framework that we work with is that if there is a government land, then it is put to the market for disposal.

00:11.974 --> 00:20.243
So I suppose there is that little bit of conflict, perceived conflict with what we do and the policy that exists.

00:20.743 --> 00:24.145
So it's probably quite variable, I guess, depending on the politics of the day.

00:24.165 --> 00:26.987
Have you mentioned that there's a framework you're working with in there?

00:27.047 --> 00:32.911
Would you say you're more guided by that framework or the politics of the day when you're making those decisions?

00:34.112 --> 00:34.753
It is the framework.

00:35.253 --> 00:44.259
So the government land transaction guidelines dictate that we are selling government land, more surplus government landage.

00:44.719 --> 00:46.741
So that's what we work within.
